  <button>this is a button</button>
  <p>The button wont do anything unless we add an event listner to it</p>
  <ul>
<li>this</li>
<li>is an</li>
<li>unordered list</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>this</li>
    <li>is an</li>
    <li>ordered list</li>
      </ol>

      <p>an element is everything between the tags and the tags them selves</p>
      <p>all elements must have a start and end tag</p>
      <p>most elements can have additional information or attributes,
        they are always added in the start tag just before the >
        an example of an attribute could be the href attribute for anchor tags that 
        allow you to go to another web page. another example could be classes or ids
      </p>
      <p>the style attribute allows you to change the style of an element with css. also known as inline styles</p>
  <p style='color:red'>i am red. i was made using inline styles instead of internal or external styles: NaN;
